# MTB
A project for detecting and counting mountain bikers and people walking in the forrest using a small bird house looking box, containing a low resolution thermal camera and a Raspberry Pi 2. The recording time is limited by the battery capacity, which currently provides us with around 12 hours of recordings.

## TODO
This overall todo list is prioritized according to what needs to be done first.
1) Contributing to scientific paper writing(deadline 12/5 2017)[AVSS](http://mivia.unisa.it/sav/)
2) Capturing and annotating data
3) Bringing the HW and SW of the prototype to a stage where the system can easily be used by non-technical persons
4) Implement improvements to e.g. the detection and tracking
5) Automated data collection by use of e.g. data connection + presentation of data

# Software
The project is primarily written in python, originally some parts were written in c++ but later every component should now be available in python.

## Getting up and running
More details on using either of the two primary groups of code is described in detail in their respective readmes.

### Data capture
"thermal capture" contains the program and scripts that runs on the raspberry pi for capturing and storing 16 bit 80x60 images at 7 fps to sd card.

### Data processing
"data processing" contains code for preparing and processing the frames after they have been captured on the raspberry pi.

#### Annotations
The annotations are located under /data/annotations/ in this repository.
TODO: annotate events in remaining clips(4)
